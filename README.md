# üîç CNN and Attention Mechanisms for Parkinson's Diagnosis and Speech Deficit Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a research project aimed at analyzing audio recordings using a deep learning approach involving a Convolutional Neural Network.

## üìä Interpretability
To enhance the interpretability of the model, an Attention Grad-CAM mechanism was implemented. This technique generates heatmaps that highlight the most relevant segments of the audio recordings for classification purposes. 

These two heatmaps show what Attention Mechanism produced for a recording of a healthy patient and for a recording of a patient with Parkinson's disease. <br> <br>

## üî¨ Lexical Analysis
From the significant segments identified by the Attention Grad-CAM, the Vosk toolkit was used to transcribe the audio.
A lexical analysis was then performed to identify the frequency of crucial words in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. 
This analysis facilitated the creation of a new text, optimized for future recording sessions, which aims to streamline the data collection process while reducing the vocal strain on patients.
